            The music industry generates <strong>$43 billion</strong> in revenues, but only 12% of that amount is the share of
            the artists generating content. Furthermore, artists have minimal control over how their music is
            distributed and little visibility into who is streaming it. To address these and other problems
            faced by artists, we are introducing JUU, a fully decentralized music streaming protocol built
            on the basis of a public blockchain infrastructure with the application of various decentralized technologies

            <h2><span>Music</span> Marketplace</h2>
            <p>
                Digital technology is revolutionizing the availability and consumption of music, but it is also posing
                serious problems for distribution. Accessing, downloading and using music for free through YouTube and other
                platforms is easy.
            </p>
            <p>
                For subscription-based platforms, such as Spotify and Apple Music, the way artists are compensated
                for the music they create has not changed significantly — meaning that even after service providers and
                labels split their shares, some artists are still paid little. Furthermore, anyone can alter the music
                available on said platforms with any decent software package, mislabel it, and upload it under a different account.
            </p>
            <p>
                Over the past few years, blockchain has become widespread across all industries.
                Thanks to blockchain technologies and tokenized artworks, independent music labels and artists are
                reaping the benefits and regaining control of their money and artwork.
            </p>
            <p>
                All eyes are on blockchain. The decentralization of the music industry can eliminate the elitism of
                music production and distribution and put money back in the pockets of artists — its real owners.
                NFTs are a development that could help revolutionize how indie artists are compensated and recognized.

            <p>
                The JUU app will be operating as a digital radio station with numerous performances from talents around
                the globe, like DJ’s, musicians, performers and others. JUU will also host its own talk shows and interviews.
                The talk shows will cover topics that are relevant to blockchain enthusiasts and musicians building their
                careers in the digital space, touching on all points where music and blockchain overlap.
                The service has no boundaries in terms of format and the team is ready to explore the possibilities of
                music tokenization together with the community of creators and market experts.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, internet radio has the potential of becoming the most ubiquitous form of media ever,
                attracting both young talents and brands to collaborate. Cryptocurrencies have always faced the
                challenge of attracting new users. Although the apps are incredibly innovative, the user experience
                leaves much to be desired. Radio creates an emotional response among its listeners and provides increased
                trust and brand awareness in return. It is a good opportunity to introduce music content creators to
                the world of blockchain technology through subcultural events and help them understand all the benefits
                that will help build a career in the digital space.

            <p>
                <strong>Preventing fake ticket sales and scams.</strong> Blockchain provides a single source of truth
                for both ticket holders and organizers. The transfer of NFTs from the initial sale to resale is stored
                on the blockchain immutably, so that all parties can prove the ticket’s authenticity.
                In cases where the resale of tickets is forbidden, the NFTs can be programmed to be non-transferrable,
                not to be moved to another buyer physically.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Reduction of costs.</strong> The costs associated with selling and minting NFTs are negligible
                compared to the traditional ticketing system. You can get an unforgeable ticket at a lower production
                cost so customers and organizers can validate the authenticity of every ticket on-chain and track the
                history of ownership.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Quick production.</strong> An NFT can be minted and be ready to sell in less than a minute.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Perpetual revenue.</strong> Since programmable NFTs can have built-in rules for merchandise, content, resales and royalty splits, the organizer can analyze profit-sharing percentages for future resales or creative content on secondary markets and receive funds, knowing that they are unalterable within the NFT’s coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>New revenue opportunities.</strong>
                NFT-based tickets act as programmable money, providing unlimited potential for new revenue opportunities.
